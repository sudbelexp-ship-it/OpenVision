## Features

### Five AI Backends — Cloud or Fully On-Device
- **Local (MLX)**: A **choice of on-device models** via Apple MLX — Qwen3 (0.6B/4B), Gemma 3 1B, Bonsai 8B (1-bit), FastVLM 0.5B — so you can trade capability for memory/speed. Private, offline, **zero API cost**. Pick **FastVLM** to unlock **on-device vision** — photo Q&A *and* a fully-offline live video mode (see below).
- **Apple Intelligence**: Apple's on-device Foundation Model (iOS 26+). **No download, no memory pressure** (OS-managed), private and offline. Uses guided generation + Apple's native tool-calling.
- **OpenClaw**: Wake word activation, 56+ tools, task execution via WebSocket
- **Gemini Live**: Real-time voice + vision with native audio streaming
- **OpenAI**: GPT-4o text + vision over the Chat Completions API — works with any **OpenAI-compatible** endpoint (OpenRouter, Groq, local servers, etc.). Also drives **live video** via the **Realtime API** (`gpt-realtime`) — continuous voice + camera frames (see below).

### Live Video — Real-Time Voice + Vision
Say **"Ok Vision, start video stream"** to enter a live mode where the glasses camera stays on and the AI answers questions about what you're seeing. Ask freely — no wake word between questions — until you say **"stop video"**. Live video routes to whichever backend you've selected:
- **Gemini Live** — native continuous audio + 1fps video (cloud).
- **OpenAI** — the **Realtime API** (`gpt-realtime`): streaming voice + camera frames over WebSocket. Uses the same OpenAI key/base URL you already set (so OpenAI-compatible gateways work too).
- **Local (FastVLM)** — **fully on-device** live video: Apple speech-to-text in, on-device FastVLM answers on the latest frame, spoken back with your chosen voice. **No cloud, no cost, works with no signal.**

### On-Device Photos (FastVLM)
With **FastVLM** selected as your local model, **"Ok Vision, take a photo and tell me what this is"** captures a frame from the glasses and answers **entirely on-device** — nothing leaves the phone. Other local models stay text-only and hand camera questions to a cloud backend.

### On-Device Neural Voice (Kokoro)
- A **natural, offline, private voice** (Kokoro-82M) running on-device via MLX — selectable from a Speech Engine dropdown with a voice picker.
- Apple's system voice stays the default (with Premium/Enhanced voice support); Kokoro is the upgrade when you want lifelike speech with **nothing leaving the phone**.

### Agentic Web Search — Real Live Information
- The models **search the web whenever they're unsure or asked about current things** — news, weather, prices, scores — and never answer "I can't access real-time data" without trying.
- **Tavily** (free tier) returns real live content for the model to summarize; **DuckDuckGo** is the keyless fallback.
- Smart flow: local models **reformulate + retry** a weak query; the OpenAI backend runs a real **function-calling loop** (call `web_search` → refine → answer).

### Conversation Memory
- Multi-turn context on the on-device and OpenAI backends: *"What's the capital of France?"* → *"What's **its** population?"* just works.
- Bounded per session so local memory stays safe; Apple keeps context via a reused native session.

### Hands-Free Productivity Tools
- Run real actions by voice: **timers**, **Pomodoro** sessions, **reminders** (Apple Reminders), **calendar** events (read today/upcoming, add), **notes** (auto-tagged with place + time), and **copy to clipboard**.
- Built on stable Apple frameworks (EventKit, UserNotifications, CoreLocation, UIPasteboard) — deterministic, no hallucination surface.
- **Pixel-perfect times:** the *tool* does the date math, not the model. Say *"remind me at 6 PM"* and it lands at exactly 6:00 PM — even on the tiny on-device model.
- One tool registry, **four backends**: OpenAI and Gemini Live (function-calling), Apple Intelligence (`Tool` protocol), and on-device Gemma 4 (JSON tool-calls) all share the same tools.
- See [docs/native-tools.md](docs/native-tools.md) for the full design.

### On-Device Face Recognition (Apple Vision)
- Teach it faces hands-free: *"Ok Vision, remember this person as Sara"*
- Recognize them later: *"Ok Vision, who is this?"*
- Runs **entirely on-device** (Apple Vision `computeDistance`) — no cloud, no photos leave your phone
- Intent is parsed by the on-device model (agentic) — **any phrasing works**, and it only triggers for a person actually in view

### Smart Voice Control
- Reliable wake word activation ("Ok Vision") for privacy — primed recognition + self-restart so it keeps listening (survives idle, replies, and glasses off/on)
- Barge-in support - interrupt AI anytime by saying "Ok Vision"
- Conversation mode - follow-up questions without wake word
- "Ok Vision stop" - stop AI mid-speech
- Audio routes correctly whether you're using the glasses or the phone alone (loud speaker, not the earpiece)

### On-Device Model Management
- Pick a local model, **download it on demand**, and **delete it to reclaim storage** anytime from Settings — swap between a tiny 0.5B model and a larger one as you like.

### Glasses Integration
- Photo capture on voice command ("take a photo")
- Live video streaming to Gemini (1fps)
- Seamless glasses registration via Meta AI app

### Production-Ready
- Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff (12 attempts)
- Network monitoring (auto-pause on WiFi drop)
- App lifecycle handling (suspend/resume connections)
- Secure credential storage

### Zero Hardcoding
- All API keys configurable in-app
- No code changes needed to use
- Example config files included

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- macOS with Xcode 15+
- Physical iOS 18+ device (simulator doesn't support Bluetooth; on-device MLX models need iOS 18)
- Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses
- Meta Developer account for glasses registration
- An AI backend — one of:
  - **Local (MLX)** — no account/key needed; a choice of on-device models (Bonsai 8B, Qwen3, Gemma 3, FastVLM). Runs on a recent iPhone (e.g. 15 Pro/16/17)
  - **Apple Intelligence** — no key or download; needs iOS 26+ on an Apple-Intelligence device (iPhone 15 Pro and newer)
  - [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) instance
  - [Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
  - [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) (or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint)

### Step 1: Clone & Configure

```bash
# Your Apple Team ID (from Xcode or Apple Developer Portal)
DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = ABC123XYZ

# Your app's bundle identifier
PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER = com.yourname.openvision

# Meta App ID from developer console
META_APP_ID = 1234567890

# Client Token - MUST be in this format: AR|APP_ID|TOKEN
CLIENT_TOKEN = AR|1234567890|abcdef123456789

# URL scheme for Meta AI callback
APP_LINK_URL_SCHEME = openvision
```

### Step 4: Build & Run

```bash
brew install xcodegen                          # one-time
xcodebuild -downloadComponent MetalToolchain   # one-time (~688 MB, for the on-device AI shaders)

xcodegen generate
open OpenVision.xcodeproj
```

1. Enable **Developer Mode** in the Meta AI app (Settings → About → tap the version 5×)
2. Select your iOS device (not simulator) and unlock it
3. Build and run (⌘R)
4. On first launch, go to **Settings → Glasses → Register**
5. This opens Meta AI app to grant access
6. Return to OpenVision

Full instructions, CLI build commands, and troubleshooting: **[SETUP.md](SETUP.md)**

### Step 5: Configure AI Backend

**For Gemini Live:**
1. Get API key from [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Settings → AI Backend → Gemini Settings
3. Paste your API key

**For OpenClaw:**
1. Install [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)
2. Settings → AI Backend → OpenClaw Settings
3. Enter gateway URL and auth token

**For OpenAI (text, vision + live video):**
1. Get an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Settings → AI Backend → **OpenAI**, paste the key (and optionally a base URL / models)
3. Say **"Ok Vision, start video stream"** to use live video over the Realtime API

**For on-device vision (FastVLM):**
1. Settings → AI Backend → **Local (MLX)**
2. Pick **FastVLM 0.5B** and tap download (~1 GB, one time)
3. Say **"take a photo and tell me what this is"**, or **"start video stream"** — all on-device

## Usage

### OpenClaw Mode (Default)

```
You: "Ok Vision"                    → Wake word activates listening
You: "What's the weather today?"    → AI processes and responds via TTS
You: "Take a photo"                 → Captures from glasses, analyzes
You: "Ok Vision stop"               → Interrupts AI mid-speech
[Silence for 30s]                   → Conversation ends
```

### Live Video Mode (Gemini · OpenAI · Local)

Works with whichever backend is selected — Gemini Live, OpenAI Realtime, or fully on-device FastVLM.

```
You: "Ok Vision, start video stream"     → Enters live video mode (uses your selected backend)
[Glasses camera streams; the AI sees continuously]
You: "What am I looking at?"             → AI sees and responds
You: "And is this a good deal?"          → Keep asking — no wake word needed
You: "Stop video"                        → Exits live video mode
```

> On the **Local (FastVLM)** backend this runs **entirely on-device** (speak toward the phone; audio and vision never leave it). On **Gemini/OpenAI** the camera frames stream to the cloud provider.

### On-Device Photo (FastVLM)

```
[Select Local → FastVLM in Settings]
You: "Ok Vision, take a photo and tell me what this is"
[Glasses capture a frame → FastVLM answers on-device → spoken reply]
```

### Voice Commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| "Ok Vision" | Activate listening (wake word) |
| "Ok Vision stop" | Stop AI while speaking |
| "Take a photo" | Capture and analyze view (on-device with FastVLM, else cloud) |
| "What do you see?" | Describe current view |
| "Remember this person as Sara" | Enroll a face (on-device) |
| "Who is this?" | Identify the person in view (on-device) |
| "Forget Sara" / "Who do you know?" | Remove / list known faces |
| "What's today's news?" / "Weather in Tokyo?" | Web search (on-device backends) |
| "What's its population?" (as a follow-up) | Uses conversation memory |
| "Set a 5 minute timer" / "Start a Pomodoro" | Timer / focus session ([native tools](docs/native-tools.md)) |
| "Remind me to call mom at 6 PM" | Reminder in Apple Reminders (exact time) |
| "Add a meeting tomorrow at 9:30am" / "What's on my calendar today?" | Calendar add / read |
| "Note that I parked in lot B" / "Search my notes for parking" | Notes, auto-tagged with place + time |
| "Start video stream" | Enter live video mode (Gemini / OpenAI Realtime / on-device FastVLM) |
| "Stop video" | Exit live video mode |

> Commands are routed by the on-device model, so you don't need exact wording — natural phrasing works, and it searches the web on its own when it doesn't know.

## AI Backend Comparison

| Backend | Voice | Vision | Cost / Privacy | Best For |
|---------|-------|--------|----------------|----------|
| **Local (MLX)** | Wake word + Apple STT | **On-device** photo + live video (FastVLM); else via a cloud backend | Free · **fully on-device** | Private chat, face commands, **offline vision** — pick Qwen/Gemma/FastVLM |
| **Apple Intelligence** | Wake word + Apple STT | via a cloud backend | Free · **on-device, no download** | Private chat on iOS 26+ devices, lowest setup |
| **OpenClaw** | Wake word + Apple STT | Photo on request | Self-hosted | Tasks, 56+ tools, control |
| **Gemini Live** | Native VAD (always on) | Continuous 1fps video | Cloud API | Natural, low-latency conversation |
| **OpenAI** | Wake word + Apple STT · Realtime VAD in live mode | Photo on request (GPT-4o) · **live video (Realtime `gpt-realtime`)** | Cloud API · OpenAI-compatible | Cloud text + vision, live video, cross-checking |

Face recognition, web search, and conversation memory all run on the **on-device** backends (Gemma, Apple) — private, no photos or queries leave your phone unless you pick a cloud backend. With **FastVLM**, photo Q&A and live video are on-device too.

## Troubleshooting

### Glasses won't register
- Ensure Meta AI app is installed and you're signed in
- Enable Developer Mode in Meta AI app settings
- Check that your Meta App ID matches the developer console

### "Configuration Invalid" error
- Verify `CLIENT_TOKEN` format: `AR|APP_ID|TOKEN`
- Check all Config.xcconfig values are filled in
- Ensure bundle ID matches what's in Meta Developer Console

### No audio from glasses
- Check Bluetooth connection in iOS Settings
- Ensure glasses are set as audio output device
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting glasses

### Gemini Live fails to connect
- Verify API key is correct
- Check internet connection
- Ensure you have Gemini API access (not all regions supported)

### OpenClaw connection drops
- App auto-reconnects up to 12 times with exponential backoff
- Check if OpenClaw server is running
- Verify gateway URL uses `wss://` (not `ws://`) for secure connection

### Key Patterns

- **@MainActor** - All managers and services are main-actor isolated
- **Callbacks** - Services use callbacks (not Combine) for events
- **Singleton managers** - GlassesManager, SettingsManager, etc.
- **Exponential backoff** - OpenClaw reconnects with jittered delay

### Building

```bash
# Build for device
xcodebuild -scheme OpenVision -destination 'platform=iOS,name=iPhone' build

# Install on connected device
xcrun devicectl device install app --device <DEVICE_ID> \
  ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/.../OpenVision.app
```
